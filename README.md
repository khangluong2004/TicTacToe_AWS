# TicTacToe 4x4 Bot Fully Deployed

## Project Plan:
A full-stack web app for user to practice tic-tac-toe on a 4x4 grid 
with an automatic bot (so they have a chance to win), aimed to be fully deployed on AWS.

Tech-stack: Serverless architecture

1. Front-end: React JS - AWS Amplify
2. Authentication: AWS Cognito
3. Back-end: Python (AWS Lambda)
4. API Networking: AWS Gateway

## Project aims:
1. Familiarize myself with Cloud computing, Serverless architecture and Hosting
2. Have fun working on classic minimax searching algorithm on the bot
3. Make a not-too-serious app that my friends (who are too lazy to do all the set up) could have a bit of fun straight away

## Progress:
1. Finished the bare UI for playing with Front-end + Deal with AWS Amplify
